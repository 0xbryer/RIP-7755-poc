# RIP-7755 Proof of Concept

## Overview

This mono repo demonstrates the RIP-7755 protocol through a proof-of-concept project, featuring smart contracts, an off-chain fulfiller backend, and a frontend UI. The core implementation is designed to support cross-chain messaging between any blockchains that post state roots to Layer 1 (L1). The frontend specifically showcases the bridging of ETH from Arbitrum Sepolia to Base Sepolia. For more information, see the active [PR](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/pull/31) detailing the proposal.
